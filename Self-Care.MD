# Self-Care as an Essential Tool in BrandMeister
<p><b>Self-Care is a very important ingredient of the BrandMeister Network.</b></p>
<p>It is important for any Repeater Keeper as well as the individual on BrandMeister to register for a Self-Care account, to set personal security, and to display up-to-date personal information.</p>
<p>It is neccessary that the user has already a DMR Id before registering for a BrandMeister Self-Care account.</p> 
<p>The act of registration may take up to 48 hours.</p> 
<p>From time to time, some email providers are not recognised by the system, so those registering should check their Spam Filter before reporting a registration failure to a member of the  administration. Any query in this regard go to the appropriate Telegram application account.</p>
<p>Once registered, a log-in permits access to edit the individual’s account. Repeater keepers requiring the addition to their account, of repeaters in their care should provide their own and their Repeater’s callsign and DMRId to a member of the admin team via the Telegram application.</p>
<p>Once this is complete, Each of the keeper’s repeaters will be accessible in the account under the <b>Sysop Dashboard.</b> This is particularly important for MMDVM repeater users, who shall require access to the BrandMeister API (Application Programming Interface).</p>
<p>Once logged in, the users callsign and chosen avatar should appear on the top red line, with a number of white menu items on the black bar to the left.</p>
<p><b>The Menus Options are:</b></p>
<p><b>User Dashboard -</b>	that gives global and current information of the state of the BrandMeister Network.</p>
<p><b>Last Heard -</b>	that provides access to a massive range of active and historical data. A fuller explanation of this tool is accessible below.</p>
<p><b>Repeaters -</b>	that can provide details of a repeater or several repeaters depending on the search parameters provided.</p>
<p><b>Hotspots -</b>	that can provide details of a known hotspot or series of hotspots depending on the search parameters provided.</p>
<p><b>Masters -</b>	Currently there are 45 Master Servers. Selecting one of these, will provided current connectivity information for the individual server.</p>
<p><b>Alerts -</b>	This displays any alerts that may have been set. For the most part this information is irrelevant for most users.</p>
<p><b>Data Visualisation -</b>	From this menu can be selected some of the visual information provided on parts of the network.</p>
<p><b>Information -</b>	From this section can be found all of the textual information available known as the BrandMeister Wiki. Described as a Database or Website designed to furnish relevant information for viewing and editing, a Wiki in any context provides information for the purposes of research. The word ‘Wiki’ in Hawaiian means “to Hurry, Fast or Quick” however the best description for it wold be the acronym for “What I Know Is…”. As most wiki’s can be edited to reflect up-to-date knowledge.</p>
<p><b>Services -</b>	This menu give access to the now unsupported hose line, Extended Routing for the DV4Mini device that is in declining usage, and finally the self-care options for individuals who primarily use a terminal (radio) and possibly a full MMDVM device.</p>
<p>Below these lines are the menus for Hotspot control and the Sysop Dashboard for Repeater Keepers.</p>

# Individual Profiles
<p>By clicking on the avatar on the top line, the user can open full access to his own profile, edit his profile settings, access new parameters for example the BrandMeister API for for the MMDVM devices under his control, and finally his own self-care dashboard.
</p>
<p>The first option	displays the user's profile image, and the <b>Last Heard</b> information relevant to his personal ID. Below the profile image is the option to edit the current user DMRId information.</p>
<p>The second option	gives access to the user to enable changes to his current email account and password and the facility to change it.<p>
<p>On the same screen can be seen a small blue panel that when clicked opens the options to create new Application Programming Information (API) for each of the MMDVM devices in his care.</p>

# The BM-API or Application Programming Information
<p>Each new API key must be given a unique name so that the user can recognise it in the future.</p>
<p>The important and noteworthy option is the ability to revoke a current API in order to remove it or renew it on a current MMDVM device.</p>
<p>For those with Pi-Star, this option is required to be set in the Configuration/Expert/BM-API. menu to fulfil full administration functions from the Pi-Star Dashboard.</p>
<p>When creating a new API is it imperative to save the textual information on a personal computer, and if possible the QR-Code, as once this window is close, the API is no longer available.</p>
<p>The option to copy the new API places the textual information on to the computer's scratch pad to permit it to be pasted directly into place on the Pi-Star BM-API menu box that is presented.</p>

# The Self-Care option
<p>It is here that the user can set a number of parameters of a hotspot, and with future rules to be introduced, a personal password for the user to use in his hotspot.</p>
<p>This will replace the 'passw0rd' that has been standard for all devices, including repeaters up until this juncture. However it shall be eventually mandatory for a personal password to be set or connectivity will be disabled.</p>
<p>It is a simple change, but will give the user full control of his rights to use the network, and will negate the ability of wilful usurpers, licenced or unlicenced, to unlawfully use the network with anothers identity.</p>
<p>In some regions, this practice of personal passwords has already begun.</p>
<p.More strongly than that, the user can set the air-security of his profile, so that when he is not active, his identity cannot be usurped.</p>
<p>Here also can be set the details that the user would like to display on aprs.fi, and also what information can be displayed on Talker Alias.</p>
<p>APRS Text can be used to display meaningful information, such as additional callsign information or a nickname of the user. It is this information that can be viewed on the the terminal screens of others if Talker Alias is enabled.</p>

# Last Heard search facilities
<p>Within the <b>last heard</b>page are some powerful search parameters.</p>
<p>Whilst not part of the Self-Care, these searches can aid in understanding the many aspects of the BrandMeister Network.</p>
<p>The first screen encountered is displaying the most recent activity on a global level, and changes very rapidly.</p>
<p><b>Search</b> on the left on its is own is limited in its results. So the first action to apply is to click on the <b>+</b> at the right-hand end.</b>
<p>This provides new boxes. On the left <h3>AND/OR</h3> and on the right <h3>Add Rule - Add Group</h3>.</p>
<p>To make the search practical, there are some settings that we shall need to understand.</p>
<h3>AND/OR</h3>
<p>The most useful of these two parameters is <h3>OR</h3> that gives a choice between parameters, whereas <h3>AND</h3> means that a number of parameters together must be true before the results will be visible. So for the most part <h3>OR</h3> must be selected by clicking on it to make it Dark Blue in colour.</p>
<p>The best way to make a search shall be the use of <h3>Add Rule</h3>. The search can be simple by using one rule, or more complicated by adding further rules. However for most purposes a single or double rule may be sufficient.</p>
<p>Clicking on <h3>Add rule</h3> produces a line with a drop-box at the far left-hand end. selecting on each of these items opens further boxes to be completed either partially or fully, to give some very powerful search parameters. The type of data may be restrictive according to the box. But remember Callsigns must be in UPPER CASE. In the most simple search, that of Destination Id, the addition of a TalkGroup number will result in the latest users of this TalkGroup when one clicks on <b>search</b></p>
<p>By applying multiple rules with different parameters with <h3OR</h3> selected, can result in tighter parameters, refining a search.</p>
